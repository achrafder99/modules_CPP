## Introduction

Module 00 of the C++ curriculum introduces the basics of Object-Oriented Programming using C++. It covers fundamental concepts and aims to provide a starting point for a C++ journey. The exercises gradually increase in complexity, helping learners build a strong foundation in C++ programming.

## General Rules

- Compile code with `c++` using flags: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`
- Follow formatting and naming conventions specified in the guidelines
- Name classes in UpperCamelCase and use appropriate file naming
- Write clean and readable code, even though no specific style is enforced
- Utilize the C++ standard library extensively but avoid external libraries
- Forbidden functions include: `printf()`, `alloc()`, `free()`, and external libraries
- Exercise-specific rules are mentioned in each exercise's section

## Exercise 00: Megaphone

Implement a program that converts input strings to uppercase and prints them. Follow the instructions in [Exercise 00](ex00/README.md) for details.

## Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook

Implement a phonebook application using classes to store and manage contacts. Follow the instructions in [Exercise 01](ex01/README.md) for details.

## Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams

Recreate a missing C++ source file based on provided header and log files. Follow the instructions in [Exercise 02](ex02/README.md) for details.

## Conclusion

These solutions demonstrate my understanding of the concepts covered in Module 00. Each exercise showcases different aspects of C++ programming, including classes, namespaces, and more.

Feel free to explore each exercise's directory for code implementations and relevant files.

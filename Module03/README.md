# C++ Module 03: Inheritance

This repository contains the solutions for the exercises in Module 03 of the C++ programming course. The module focuses on inheritance and object-oriented programming concepts in C++.

## Introduction

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes." The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This module serves as a starting point for your C++ journey, introducing you to the basics of inheritance.

## General Rules

- Compile your code with `c++` and the flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
- Code should be compliant with the C++98 standard.
- Follow proper formatting and naming conventions.
- Use the C++ standard library for your code.
- Avoid forbidden functions and external libraries.
- Design classes in the Orthodox Canonical Form.
- Implement functions in header files and handle dependencies correctly.
- Read the guidelines thoroughly before starting each exercise.

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!

Implement a class called `ClapTrap` with attributes for name, hit points, energy points, and attack damage. Add member functions for attacking, taking damage, and being repaired.

### Exercise 01: Serena, my love!

Create a derived class named `ScavTrap` that inherits from `ClapTrap`. Customize constructors, destructor, and attack messages. Add a unique member function `guardGate()`.

### Exercise 02: Repetitive work

Implement a class named `FragTrap` that also inherits from `ClapTrap`. Customize constructors, destructor, and attack messages. Add a unique member function `highFivesGuys()`.

### Exercise 03: Now itâ€™s weird!

Create a class named `DiamondTrap` that inherits from both `FragTrap` and `ScavTrap`. Incorporate attributes and member functions from both parent classes. Add a unique member function `whoAmI()`.

Introduction
C++ Module 01 is part of the curriculum designed to introduce you to memory allocation, pointers, references, and the switch statement in C++. The module serves as a foundation for understanding key concepts in C++ programming.

General Rules
Compile your code with c++ and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
Code should still compile with the flag -std=c++98.
Adhere to formatting and naming conventions specified in the guidelines.
Memory allocation must avoid memory leaks.
Classes must be designed following the Orthodox Canonical Form.
Avoid placing function implementations in header files.
Ensure header files include all dependencies and use include guards.
Additional guidelines are provided for specific exercises.
Exercises
Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
Implement a Zombie class with attributes and member functions to simulate zombie behavior. Explore memory allocation and pointers in the context of creating zombies.

Exercise 01: Moar brainz!
Create a zombie horde using dynamic memory allocation. Explore creating and managing an array of zombies.

Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN
Explore memory addresses, pointers, and references with a string variable. Display the memory addresses and values associated with different aspects of the string.

Exercise 03: Unnecessary violence
Implement a Weapon class and HumanA, HumanB classes with different characteristics. Understand the differences between using pointers and references in different scenarios.

Exercise 04: Sed is for losers
Implement a program that reads a file, replaces occurrences of one string with another, and writes the modified content to a new file. Explore string manipulation and file handling.

Exercise 05: Harl 2.0
Create a Harl class that simulates different complaint levels. Use pointers to member functions to automate Harl's complaints.

Exercise 06: Harl filter
Implement a program to filter and display Harl's complaints based on specified log levels. Use the switch statement to control the output

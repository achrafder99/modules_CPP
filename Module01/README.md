## Introduction

Module 01 of the C++ curriculum delves into memory allocation, pointers, references, and the switch statement. These exercises provide practical experience in managing memory, using pointers and references effectively, and understanding switch statements.

## General Rules

- Compile code with `c++` using flags: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`
- Follow formatting and naming conventions specified in the guidelines
- Name files, classes, functions, etc., according to the provided guidelines
- Write clean, readable code; adhering to your preferred style
- Utilize the C++ standard library, avoiding external libraries
- Forbidden functions and practices are outlined in the guidelines
- Implement tests to verify the correctness of your solutions
- Ensure memory leaks are avoided and handle errors appropriately

## Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ

Implement a Zombie class and functions to manage zombies. For details, refer to [Exercise 00](ex00/README.md).

## Exercise 01: Moar brainz!

Implement a function to create a zombie horde using dynamic memory allocation. For details, refer to [Exercise 01](ex01/README.md).

## Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN

Create a program that explores memory addresses and references. For details, refer to [Exercise 02](ex02/README.md).

## Exercise 03: Unnecessary violence

Implement classes to simulate humans wielding weapons and attacking. For details, refer to [Exercise 03](ex03/README.md).

## Exercise 04: Sed is for losers

Write a program that replaces occurrences of a string in a file. For details, refer to [Exercise 04](ex04/README.md).

## Exercise 05: Harl 2.0

Create a class to automate Harl's messages at different levels. For details, refer to [Exercise 05](ex05/README.md).

## Exercise 06: Harl filter

Implement a program to filter Harl's messages based on log levels. For details, refer to [Exercise 06](ex06/README.md).

## Introduction

C++ Module 04 covers Object-Oriented Programming concepts, focusing on subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. The goal is to implement various classes and demonstrate a deep understanding of polymorphism in C++.

## General Rules

- Code should be compiled with `c++` using flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
- Code should adhere to the C++98 standard.
- Naming conventions and formatting guidelines are provided for consistency.
- Memory management and avoiding memory leaks are emphasized.
- External libraries like C++11 and Boost are forbidden.
- Read the instructions carefully before starting each exercise.

## Exercise 00: Polymorphism

In this exercise, we create a base class `Animal` with subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`. Polymorphism is demonstrated by implementing the `makeSound()` function.

## Exercise 01: I don’t want to set the world on fire

This exercise focuses on memory management using constructors and destructors. We implement a `Brain` class and demonstrate deep copying and memory leak prevention.

## Exercise 02: Abstract Class

In this exercise, we prevent the instantiation of the base class `Animal` by making it abstract. The concept of abstract classes and interfaces is explored.

## Exercise 03: Interface & Recap

In this final exercise, we implement interfaces using pure abstract classes. We create the `AMateria`, `Ice`, `Cure`, `ICharacter`, and `MateriaSource` classes to demonstrate polymorphism and deep copying.
